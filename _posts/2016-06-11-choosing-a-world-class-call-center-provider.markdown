One of the biggest issues surrounding e-commerce business is poor service quality and support. Too often is this over-looked, and the effects it can have on your business and brand; both positive and negative – are detrimentally underestimated.

Think brand ambassador, think image, think reputation management – all of which are directly linked with providing world class customer support. You can have the best manufacturer, fulfillment provider, traffic source, and product or service itself – but without a well-trained industry-specific professional answering the phone, how else can your customers continue to trust in and contribute to your business?

Finding a first-rate customer service provider is essential to the success of your business, regardless of the quality of service or product you are providing, because each call center agent is a direct reflection of your brand, your company, and you. So how do you go about selecting the right call center provider for your business?

First things first – decide what metrics mean most to you. Do you want low call handling times and lenient refund policies because you want to get customers satisfied quickly and off the phone, or do you want product specific experts describing product application and benefits because you’re trying to build up a dedicated and retained consumer base?
 

You could say yes to both – why not, but when choosing a center, it’s important to nail down what really determines the success of your campaign. Low CPAs, high volume, short calls, and easy cancellation? Go Offshore. High CPAs, brand management, continuity offers and high price points? Stay Domestic. Either way – take all things into consideration before choosing your center, because they’ll be the main representation of your business: *You never get a second chance at a first impression with your customers – so you'd better make it a good one.*
